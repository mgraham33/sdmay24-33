  <pl-statement match="If in count down mode the counter starts from the loaded value and stops once it reaches 0. 
  In count up mode the counter starts from 0 and stops when it reaches the loaded value. In count down mode the prescaler is used as a proper perscaler, 
  in count up mode it extends a 16-bit counter to 24-bits

  <pl-statement match="The same behavior as One shot mode, with the major difference being the timer does not stop. 
  If in count up mode, then when it reaches its max value (i.e. loadedvalue) it goes back to 0 and continues counting. If in count down mode, 
  then when it reaches 0 it goes back to its max value (i.e. loaded value) and continues counting">Periodic mode</pl-statement>

  <pl-statement match="Allows the counter to capture the time at which the edge of an input signal occurs
