    <h1>Interrupt-based Device Interaction</h1>
    <p>
        Using interrupts and "One Shot Mode," complete 'CAMERA_HANDLER()' and 'student_main()' so that each time a pixel of data is ready to be read:
        <ul>
            <li>The ISR increments the number of pixels that have been read</li>
            <li>'student_main()' calls <b>print_pixel_count()</b> exactly once each time the ISR has indicated a new pixel is ready to be read</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Declare additional variables you believe you need (hint: you will likely need a variable for counting pixels and one for indicating a pixel is ready to be read)
    </p>
    <p><i>Note: The 'print_pixel_count()' function takes one argument: an int of the number of pixels that have been read.</i></p>
