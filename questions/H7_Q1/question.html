            As part of your training, to better contribute to your Project teams choosing a problem to solve with an
            embedded system, this exercise with give you some experience with the first stage of this process:
            <b>Identifying Users and their Needs</b>. You will be collaborating with your Lab partner for this exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
            A number of established tools exist to guide a team through this process. For this case, we will make
            use of two tools: 1) Empathy Maps, and 2) Point-of-View statements. Review the following two
            resources for a quick overview for how to use these two tools and the motivation for using them.

            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/empathy-map-why-and-how-to-use-it">Empathy Map</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/define-and-frame-your-design-challenge-by-creating-your-point-of-view-and-ask-how-might-we">Point-of-View Statements</a> (steps 1-4)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is a very brief summary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Empathy Map:</b> A structure to document and organize your "research" on Users (potential Users) in the topic area you are looking to solve a problem.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Point-of-View Statements:</b> Leverages the User information you capture using a tool, such as a
                Empathy Map. This information is used to express a list of User needs in the form "<u>User_A</u>
                needs <u>Need_B</u> because <u>Reason_C</u>". Simple example: "<u>5 year old child</u> needs <u>a way to access
                a high bookshelf</u> because <u>they want to read</u>."
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After completing this process, you should:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Have a better sense for how to go about gathering information on Users</li>
            <li>Get pracitce expressing their needs</li>
            <li>Gain experience collaborating with your Lab partner by: a) agreeing upon a shared topic to pursue, and b) learning to share and give feedback on your User research, Empathy Map, and list of Point-of-View statements.</li>
            <li>Be better prepared to go through a similar process while working with your Project team (4 person team) to develop your Team's Project Proposal.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <b>System View:</b> The figure below shows the system view of this process. First, notes that you take while
            collecting User research from several sources will be organized and analyzed within an Empathy Map.
            The output from the Empathy Map will be a List of User needs in the form of Point-of-View statements.
