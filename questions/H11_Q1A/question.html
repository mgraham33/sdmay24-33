        Potential answer:
        <br>
        One advantage of the 32-bit ARM instruction set is that it can typically carry out more complex operations than the ARM-Thumb instruction set.
        <br>
        One advantage of the 16-bit ARM-Thumb instruction set is that the code takes up less space than the 32-bit ARM instructions.
