    b) Assume you updated your solution for 2b, for the case where all the Buttons were connected to PortB, and all the LEDs were connected to PortC. Now look in tm4c123gh6pm.h (found on the course website resource page at “Tiva TM4C123GH6PM Device Register Names (Quick Look up)” ) for the definition of GPIO_PORTB_DATA_R. If this definition <b>did not</b> use the keyword volatile, then based on the articles you read about the keyword volatile, what type of issue do you think your solution may have?
