    <p>
        <b>Immediate Offset Addressing Mode</b>: The location loaded from or stored to is the value of a
        "base-address" register, plus the value of a constant. Additionally, the "base-address" register
        can optionally be incremented or decremented after the load / store completes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Regsister Offset Addressing Mode</b>: The location loaded from or stored to is the value of a
        "base-address" register, plus the value of an "offset" register.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PC-Relative Addressing Mode</b>: The location loaded from or stored to is the value in the PC
        register +/- a constant value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Load / Store Multiple Registers Addressing Mode</b>: Loads or stores a list of registers from
        or to a sequential location in Data Memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PUSH and POP Register Addressing Mode</b>: PUSH and POP are used to place or remove data from
        the top of the stack, which is located in Data Memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Load / Store Exclusive Addressing Mode</b>: A mode that is used to help guarantee one process
        at a time is accessing a register (typically used for multi-process systems)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Inherent Addressing Mode</b>: Not really an addressing mode, just means that register names 
        are specified as inputs to be operated on (i.e. Data Memory is not accessed).
