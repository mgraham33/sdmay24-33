    <h1>Square Waves</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Part B:</b> Now assume there is no PWM mode, and you have to use a Generic Waveform Generation approach
        (i.e. using an Interrupt Service Routine) to generate a symmetric square wave. Also assume that
        the time to setup and execute the code in your ISR takes {{params.overhead}} us (i.e. the CPU overhead involved
        with the ISR). What CPU utilization (i.e. percent of the CPU time) would be spent handling interrupts for:
